# IPL-Analysis-2008-2020

# Objective
To perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL matches from 2008 to 2020 using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib/Seaborn), identify player/team trends, and prepare clean data for visualization in Power BI.

# Datasets Used
matches.csv – Contains information about each IPL match: teams, venue, winner, toss, etc.
deliveries.csv – Ball-by-ball details: batsman, bowler, runs scored, wickets taken, etc.

# Data Exploration Summary
We cleaned and merged the matches.csv and deliveries.csv datasets.Unnecessary and null columns were removed, and datatypes were optimized. Then, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights on teams, players, and match outcomes. Key analyses included:
Match-level Stats: Total matches played, season-wise trends, top-performing teams.
Batsman Performance: Total runs, 4s/6s, strike rates; top batsmen identified.
Bowler Performance: Wickets, economy rates; top bowlers visualized.
Team-wise Performance: Yearly champions, win percentages, toss vs match results.
Geographic Distribution: Most matches played in cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, and Delhi.

# Key Insights
Mumbai Indians are the most consistent team with maximum titles.
Players like Virat Kohli and David Warner dominate batting charts.
Bowlers like Malinga, Bumrah are most economical & effective.
Winning the toss gives a slight but not guaranteed edge.
Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata host most games.
